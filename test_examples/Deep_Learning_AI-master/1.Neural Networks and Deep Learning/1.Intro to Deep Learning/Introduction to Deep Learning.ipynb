    "The performance of traditional machine learning algorithms will stall, no matter how much data is available. On the other hand, very large neural networks will show an increasingly better performance as the available amount of data increases. Nowadays, data storage is cheaper, and the popularity of websites and smartphones allow to generate a large amount of data! That's why deep learning is so exciting right now."
